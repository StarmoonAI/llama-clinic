These \ninfections are very common. Most last about a \nweek, but the symptoms of cough and runny \nnose may last 2-3 weeks. The fever should settle \nafter 5 days, with the temperature usually being \nhighest early in the illness. (see graph below)\n\nSometimes a child's fever may be due to a \nbacteria. It can be difficult to tell the difference \nbetween a fever due to a virus and one due to a \nbacteria, particularly early in the illness. If your \ndoctor suspects a bacterial infection, they may \ngive your child antibiotics. Fevers from bacterial \ninfections usually settle after 1-3 days of starting \nthe antibiotics.\n\nSometimes a fever lasts longer than 5 days and \nmight be due to a rarer cause.

If the baby’s nappies aren’t changed \noften enough, then this can also cause nappy rash.\n\nNappy rash usually clears up after a few days of \ngentle cleaning with water and cotton wool or \nalcohol/fragrance-free wipes (from front to back), \ntwice daily bathing, exposing their bottoms to the \nair as much as possible, use of barrier cream and \navoiding soaps, bubble bath and talcum powder.\n\nIf the rash doesn’t settle or if there are red spots and \nyour baby‘s skin folds are red, they may have nappy \nrash or ‘thrush’. Speak to your Health Visitor or \nPharmacist who may have cream that can help.\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\nChicken pox is highly infectious, (from 3 days before the \nrash begins until all spots have crusted over), so avoid \ncontact with anyone with no known history of chicken \npox themselves, new-born babies and anyone with a \nweak immune system, such as people who are having \nchemotherapy (a treatment for cancer) or taking daily \nsteroid tablets.\n\nThere is usually no need to see a doctor. Very \noccasionally chicken pox can cause more serious \nsymptoms. If you are worried that your child is quite \nunwell (see traffic light chart on page 11), please contact \nyour GP or 111.\n\nIt is not advised to given ibuprofen for pain or fever if a \nchild has chickenpox. Paracetamol is the preferred \ntreatment option when pain/fever is causing distress.\n\nFor itchy skin apply calamine lotion, \ncooling gels.

It \nis much more common in formula-fed babies (5 in every \n100 babies) compared to breast-fed babies (less than 1 \nin every 100 babies) because formula milk is made from \ncow’s milk. \n\nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\nCMPA sometimes occurs in breast-fed babies if they eat \nor drink even a little bit of cow‘s milk \nprotein e.g. in mum’s breast \nmilk if she drinks cow‘s milk, \nor when weaned onto solids \nthat contain cow’s milk. \n\nAlthough children usually \ngrow out of CMPA by 5 \nyears of age, it can cause \ntroublesome symptoms in \nthose early years, which \nmeans it is important to detect and treat it sooner rather \nthan later. Diagnosis involves completely removing cow’s \nmilk from the diet to see if symptoms resolve.\n\nIf you’re worried your baby may have a possible problem \nwith cow’s milk you should talk to your Health Visitor or \nGP. Cow’s milk contains many important substances that \nare difficult to find in other foods and milks, so don’t stop \ngiving your baby cow’s milk until you have spoken to a \nhealth professional.\n\nIf your HV or GP thinks that your baby might have CMPA, \nthey will advise you what needs to be done including \nalternative milks, foods and food supplements. Soya milk \nis not a suitable replacement and should not be given \nto children.\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n\fInfective conjunctivitis, viral or bacterial infection, \nusually doesn’t need treatment with antibiotics, \nbecause in most cases the symptoms of red eyes and \ndischarge usually clear up by themselves within a \nweek.\n\nIf the eye redness and coloured discharge is worse \nbetween day 5-7, then antibiotic eye drops may help \nin these cases.\n\nCrusting on lids and discharge can be cleaned away \nwith cotton wool and cooled boiled water. This is \nalso soothing.\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis can be helped by antihistamine \nmedicine and by avoiding pollen or dust.\n\nIrritant conjunctivitis will clear up within in a few \ndays as long as the eyes are not still in contact with \nthe irritant.\n\nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\nSeeing an optician for the first time\n\nIt’s recommended that children from 3 years of age \nattend for regular eyesight tests with an optician. \nThese eye tests are free for children under 16 years \nof age.\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\nIF YOU’RE UNSURE, OR IF THE PROBLEM DOESN’T \nSETTLE, SPEAK TO YOUR GP OR CONTACT 111\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \no\nt\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\nMost babies start to get their first teeth between 4-9 \nmonths of age (teething).
